# Postcoders Interview Task

We need you to fix some bugs and build some new features for our React app - Postcoders.

Please _read all the instructions_ below before your interview.

## The App - Postcoders

`Postcoders` is a React app that provides users with information about UK postcodes, by fetching data from the _Zippopotamus_ API (https://api.zippopotam.us).

## Local Setup

-   You'll need node version 16 or above
-   Fork and clone this repo
-   Install dependencies (`npm install`)
-   Run locally (`npm run dev`)

## Your Tasks

We will pair program with you on completing up to six tasks. You are not expected to finish all the tasks in the short time available. You will be given feedback on your ability to demonstrate your approach to solving problems, investigating issues and overcoming obstacles.

ðŸ’¡ The important outcome of this interview isn't "solving as many tasks as possible in the time available", it's "demonstrating to your pair how you solve problems".

## Before the Interview

-   Ensure the app is running by following the steps in `Local Setup` above.
-   Relax!
